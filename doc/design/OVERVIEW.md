Gameplay can be succinctly described as: Monster Hunter meets tower defense. <br/>
- The player starts with a team of hunters, which are agents that execute a series of tasks.
- The player can construct buildings, engage in combat with enemies, and gather resources.
  - Buildings include defensive fortifications (towers), walls, resource-processing hubs, buff areas, and more.
  - Combat yields special resources that can be used to craft upgraded equipment for hunters.
  - Resources can be used to purchase additional hunters.
- The player should explore and establish multiple settlements.
- Periodically, giant "legendary" monsters will appear that can either be hunted, repelled, or just ignored.
  - Legendary monsters yield special material rewards.
